# Match-Management-System
A backend system created using SQL for database, HTML & CSS for the website. 
## Brief
Using MSSQL, I created a database system for registering and managing everything that could be related to a match. From fans being able to register, buy tickets, and attend matches, to club representatives being able register their club, request to host a match on their stadium and record and see their upcoming matches too.
I used ASP.NET technology to connect the database to the frontend interface so that it becomes a functional website.
